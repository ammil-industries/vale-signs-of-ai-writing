  "Add formulaic list introduction detection rule

Detects AI-typical list markers like 'Here are some key points'.

Severity: suggestion
Patterns: 6
False positive rate: 20-30%

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing

Analysis:
AI loves introducing lists with formulaic phrases. However, lists are
standard in many legitimate contexts (technical docs, instructions, emails).
Keep at suggestion level. Useful for detecting formulaic AI structure but
has many legitimate uses in documentation."

  "Add passive voice detection rule

Detects excessive passive constructions common in AI.

Severity: suggestion
Patterns: 4
False positive rate: 30-40%

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing

Analysis:
AI uses passive constructions to sound authoritative without committing
to claims. Passive voice has legitimate uses in formal writing, especially
when discussing reception/perception. Keep at suggestion level. Passive
voice isn't wrong, excessive passive voice is."

Detects markdown numbering like '1) **Bold**' in non-markdown.

Severity: suggestion
Patterns: 6
False positive rate: context-dependent

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing

Analysis:
These are correct markdown formatting conventions. Context-dependent
indicator - error in wiki markup or HTML, correct in actual .md files.
Should add file-type awareness to only flag in non-markdown contexts.
Keep at suggestion level."

  "Add narrative language detection rule

Detects story-arc language like 'journey', 'from humble beginnings'.

Severity: suggestion
Patterns: 10
False positive rate: 25-35%

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing

Analysis:
AI uses narrative arc language as filler. Many subjects genuinely have
journeys, evolutions, and humble origins (biographies, company histories).
Problem is applying narrative framing to everything. Keep at suggestion.
Flag for review in encyclopedia/technical contexts."

Detects unspecific claims like 'wide range of' without details.

Severity: suggestion
Patterns: 5
False positive rate: 30-40%

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing

Analysis:
Problem is vagueness. 'Wide range of features' without specifying is AI
fluff. 'Supports 50+ file formats including PDF, DOCX, CSV' is accurate.
Keep at suggestion level. Useful to catch vague claims but acceptable
when backed by specifics."

Severity: suggestion
Patterns: 5
False positive rate: 40-50%

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing

Analysis:
AI uses superlatives without justification. Superlatives are legitimate
when verifiable. 'Revolutionary' needs evidence of revolution. Keep at
suggestion with note: verify superlatives with evidence. Legitimate in
marketing copy and when describing actual breakthroughs."

  "Add scare quotes detection rule

Detects excessive quotation marks around common words.

Severity: suggestion

False positive rate: 60%+

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing

Analysis:
AI overuses quotes for hedging/emphasis. Pattern is too crude - catches
ANY quoted word near a verb. Will flag legitimate technical definitions,
source quotes, and standard scare quote usage. Consider removing or
completely redesigning this rule."

Severity: suggestion
Patterns: 1 (occurrence-based)
False positive rate: 40-50%

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing

Analysis:
AI overuses colons for emphasis and list structures. Many legitimate
contexts require multiple colons (citations, time stamps, ratios, IPv6
addresses, code). Keep at suggestion but should add exceptions for
citation patterns or increase threshold to 3-4 colons."
