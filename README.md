# Vale Style: Signs of AI Writing

A [Vale](https://vale.sh) style for detecting linguistic patterns characteristic of AI-generated text. This ruleset implements detection patterns documented in Wikipedia's "[Signs of AI Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing)" guidance, focusing on identifying content that may have been generated by large language models like ChatGPT.

## Installation

To get started, add the package to your local `.vale.ini` configuration file (as shown below) and then run `vale sync`.

```ini
StylesPath = styles

Packages = https://github.com/ammil-industries/vale-signs-of-ai-writing/releases/latest/download/signs-of-ai-writing.zip

[*]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, signs-of-ai-writing
```

Alternatively, download the [latest release](https://github.com/ammil-industries/vale-signs-of-ai-writing/releases/latest/download/signs-of-ai-writing.zip) (zip), extract and copy the "signs-of-ai-writing" directory to your StylesPath, and include it in your configuration file:

## Limitations

This style is designed to raise awareness for human review, not to automatically determine if text is AI-generated. Please note:

- **False positives are possible**: Many patterns appear in legitimate human writing, especially formal academic or business writing
- **Context matters**: Some flagged patterns are appropriate in certain contexts
- **Not a complete solution**: This should be one signal among many, not the sole basis for determining AI authorship
- **Requires human judgment**: Patterns should be reviewed by humans who can assess context and intent

The highest-confidence indicators (error-level rules) have very low false positive rates, but suggestion-level rules may flag legitimate writing styles.

## Attribution

This Vale style is derived from content on Wikipedia, specifically the "[Signs of AI Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing)" documentation page and related discussion. The patterns implemented here are based on linguistic and technical indicators documented by the Wikipedia editing community.
